# things to do:
# - add an algorithm that shows the attendance of students over a short period of time (e.g. a week)
# - add a feature to calculate the average attendance for a student
# - add a feature to calculate the average attendance for the class
# - add in functionality to have a student be called out for a specific day, not affecting their overall attendance

# consider having a child object for each student, with a tuple of days attended, missed, and excused
